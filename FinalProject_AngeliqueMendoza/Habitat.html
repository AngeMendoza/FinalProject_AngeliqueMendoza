    <h1>Habitat</h1>
    


    <p> It was once believed that Apatosaurus was too massive to support its own weight on dry land, so it was theorized 
that the sauropod must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in a swamp. The findings do not support this and debunked this speculation. In fact, like its relative Diplodocus, Apatosaurus was a grazing animal with a very long neck, and a long tail that served as a counterweight. Fossilized footprints indicate that it probably lived in herds. To aid in processing food, Apatosaurus may have swallowed gizzard stones (gastroliths) the same way many birds do today â€” its jaws alone were not sufficient to chew tough plant fibersound feeding. 
    This animal has four massice and pillarlike legs, and the tail is extremely long and whiplike. 
    Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb.
