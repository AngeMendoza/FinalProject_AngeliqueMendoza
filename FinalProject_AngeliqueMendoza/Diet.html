    <h1>About the Apatosauras</h1>

    <p> Apatosauras is a giant herbivorous sauropod dinosaur, which is one of th largest land animals of all time,
        that lived between 147 million and 137 million years ago. This was during the last jurassic
    and early cretaceous periods. The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet.
    The snout of Apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only Nigersaurus having a squarer skull.
    The braincase of Apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids.
    Some skulls of Apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.
    Apatosaurus weigh as much as 41 tonnes and measures up to 23 meters long, that is including its long neck and tail. 
    Diplodocids like Apatosaurus are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. 
    Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, 
    and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding. This animal has four massice and pillarlike legs, and the tail is extremely long and whiplike. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb.

 <p>Apatosauras was first described by American paleontologist O.C. Marsh in 1877. Two years later described another sauropod,Brontosauras.
     Then American paleontologist Elmer Riggs in 1903 ascribed the differences between the two genera to growth and deemed the Apatosaurus to be
     a young Brontosaurus. The chang would soon take some time to become accepted in museums, and much longer in popular culture.
